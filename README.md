# Harmattan Project Templates

A script to create a new project from templates was available in
[Harmattan][1] for both QML and MeeGoTouch projects, licensed as GPL.

This is just a mirror with the hope that it will be useful for other
platforms ([Ubuntu Phone OS][2], [Jolla's Sailfish OS][3]) of the
original sources available at [http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com][4].

(I am also attributing the authorship to Juha-Pekka Jokela, who is
listed as the contact in the script).
